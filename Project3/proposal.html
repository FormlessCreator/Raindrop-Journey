      <h2>High Concept</h2>
      <p>Guide a raindrop at the bottom of the forest to move through various obstacles and trials with skill-based leaping mechanics to place it at the top of the tree!</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Genre</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adventure</li>
        <li>Platformer</li>
        <li>Skill-based</li>
        <li>Time-based</li>
        <li>Puzzle-solving</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Platform</h2>
      <p>It can be played on Desktop web, but if I have enough time, I could implement a mobile version of it.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>A sentient raindrop finds itself falling from the sky after an unforeseen storm. It lands in a rainforest with tall trees blocking its view of the sun and sky. With hopes of reuniting with its friends in the clouds through evaporation, the raindrop must leap across falling leaves to reach the top of the trees. If the raindrop falls to the ground, it splatters to pieces and loses its memory. Wind gusts can move the leaves, and if the raindrop doesn't reach its goal in time, it loses cohesion and memories.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
      <p>I am aiming for a pixelated animation for the raindrop's movement and jumping. I also hope to animate the leaves using JavaScript and create a forest-like background that changes based on the raindrop's height using an image.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>Instructions using text and storyline will guide the player. Players can move without jumping or leap left or right onto leaves. Power-ups and obstacles will affect gameplay, and players must use their skill to navigate safely.</p>

      <p>I am unsure if I will use an external library yet.</p>
